## Hey, I'm Ganon. 👋

## About Me

🐦‍🔥 I'm a data scientist and software engineer with a background in public policy and civic tech. I am currently in the University of Chicago's Computational Analysis and Public Policy Program.

🌆 I want to develop systems that use data to identify and serve community needs.

💻 My experience ranges from back-end development to data analysis to webpage design and support.

## Project Highlights

🔍 With the Mansueto Insitute and Illinois Answers Project, I built a program to performed OCR extraction on typed and written reports from Illinois's jails and turn it into a cleaned database.

📰 I produced data visualizations in Python and D3 to accompany my own analysis of different aspects of California and Texas's prison systems.
